This repo is for the CE888 Data Science and Decision Making assignment.
The goal for the assignment is to analyse and interpret the actions of an Atari game-based reinforcement learning agent.

The original code for this agent can be found here: https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack/tree/master/examples/A3C-Gym

Currently, only the data has been gathered, which can be found below (NOTE: The linke requires an essex account to view)
